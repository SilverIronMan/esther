<h3 class="center bold">What Is Reiki, and How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>Reiki is a Tibetan form of Energy Healing, rediscovered and promoted by Sensei Mikao Usui of Gifu, Japan.</p>
<p><span class="bold">REI</span> - Universal Spiritual Consciousness, or Spiritually Guided Consciousness </p>
<p><span class="bold">KI</span> - Life Force Energy. In Sanskrit it's known as Prana, in Chinese as Chi.</p>
<p>Translated, the meaning of Reiki is therefore: 'Spiritually Guided Life Force Energy'. The Life Force Energy is of the Creator, it permeates our universe and everyone/everything within it. Its limitless abundance can be accessed and used to create balance and wellness in every aspect of our lives. Just as there is "Medicine" with its various specialties, there is "Spiritual Healing" with its various modalities. Just as there are different radio frequencies, the same is true of healing energy. Reiki is a particular, gentle, non-invasive frequency. </p>
<p>Reiki is an ancient art of hands-on healing.  The ability to channel Reiki is passed from Reiki Master to Student through an Attunement process. Following the Attunement, Reiki flows through the practitioner's hands, a powerful tool to heal ourselves and each other physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. </p>
<p>Reiki reduces stress and promotes a feeling of peace and well being, energizes and boost the immune system, and enhances other health care practices. Use Reiki to reduce feelings of helplessness when faced with a serious illness or dis-ease ~ yours or another's.  Reiki works equally well on plants, animals, food, water and medications ~ everything!</p>
<p>Reiki is a spiritual practice, but it is not a religion. One need not 'believe in Reiki in order for it to work.  All one needs is to be willing to try it!</p>

<h3 class="center bold">What is Therapeutic Touch?</h3>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.assets.img }}bio_energy.jpg" class="right">

<p>Therapeutic Touch is a contemporary healing modality drawn from ancient practices and developed by Dora Kunz and Dolores Krieger. The practice is based on the assumptions that human beings are complex fields of energy, and that the ability to enhance healing in another is a natural potential.</p>
<p>Therapeutic Touch (TT) is used to balance and promote the flow of human energy. It is taught in colleges around the world and has a substantial base of formal and clinical research. This research has shown that TT is useful in reducing pain, improving wound healing, aiding relaxation, and easing the dying process. </p>

<h3 class="center bold">What is Healing Touch?</h3>
<p>The Healing Touch was developed by Janet Mentgen, a nurse.  Over the last 17 years Healing Touch has been effective in demonstrating a positive impact in the health care community. Healing Touch is widely respected and increasingly accepted, not only in the United States, but in many countries around the globe. It is considered one of the leading energy medicine programs in the world and is used in hospitals and medical centers.</p>
<p>Practitioners use their hands with light or near-body touch to help clear, balance and energize the human energy system, thus promoting healing for the mind, body and/or spirit. </p>
