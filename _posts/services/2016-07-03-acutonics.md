<p>Acutonics&reg; is system of vibrational sound healing rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine and philosophy that utilizes tuning forks and sound instruments such as Tibetan bowls or bells.  Using acupressure points, tuning forks are struck and then placed on the points allowing the sound and vibration to penetrate deeply into the body, mind and spirit.</p>

<p>Acutonics&reg; is an energy based non-invasive treatment similar to acupuncture and supports the bodyâ€™s natural frequencies to align and rebalance disruptions in energy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Chakras:</span> Seven centers of energy that constitute our bodies energy system. The chakras act as valves or conduits for energy from consciousness through the endocrine and nervous systems to different parts of the physical body.</p>

<p>Clients have found an Acutonics&reg; and sound therapy session to be very comforting and relaxing.  In preliminary patient outcome studies done by Esther Johnson, clients report excellent relief from nausea, constipation, pain and shortness of breath.  Some patients report feeling the benefits from a treatment for up to several days. </p>

<p><span class="bold">How Acutonics&reg; is provided:</span> Treatments are done by placing tuning forks on acupressure points, or using them in the energy field around the body or over Chakras. During the treatment the use of sound instruments may also be used in the environment or placed on the body.</p>

<p>Dr. Mitchell Gaynor, an oncologist, uses sound therapy with all his cancer patients. Here he demonstrates using a Tibetan Bowl.  He has written the book, <u>The Healing Power of Sound</u> which provides information on exercises to use the voice and sound instruments for health, healing and wellness.</p>

<p class="border">Acutonics&reg; is intended to enhance and compliment traditional medicine, never to replace it.  You should not stop taking your regular medications while using Acutonics&reg;.</p>
