<p>Relaxation Skills use the mind-body connection to effect desired changes. Using simple suggestions, the practitioner guides the patient or family member in mentally creating the desired changes in his or her physical or emotional state. Techniques using the mind-body connection have proven very effective in reducing stress and anxiety, and have also proven helpful in pain management. Relaxation skills include breathing techniques, progressive muscle relaxation, affirmations, imagery and hypnosis.</p>
<p>Relaxation skills are a key component in helping individuals feel more comfortable.  We all possess the ability to trigger our own natural relaxation response.  When an individual is able to tap into their own relaxation response it allows breaking out of the fear-tension-pain cycle or helps them find peace and calm.  Although relaxation training is seldom a complete treatment for an individual’s condition, illness or dis-ease, it is often a significant method to help manage one’s health. </p>

<h3 class="bold center">Aromatherapy </h3>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.assets.img }}aromatherapy.jpg" class="left">

<p>The use of herbal medicines dates back thousands of years and has included aromatics.  Aromatherapy uses fragrant concentrated plant oils to positively affect mood or health.  This natural treatment may help balance emotions through interaction with the limbic system.  Aromatherapy uses the aromatic properties of essential oils from various plants to bring about the relief of symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and nausea. A massage or bath using appropriate oil can bring about more significant relaxation than when the oil is not present. In some cases, oils can be introduced to the environment through a diffuser or simply by placing a few drops on a handkerchief, bringing about the reduction of troublesome symptoms.  Often essential oils are blended into a lotion or carrier oil to be used to treat specific conditions, emotional imbalances, or treat illness or dis-ease. </p>
<p>Aromatherapy is thought to work by stimulating smell receptors in the nose, which then sends messages through the nervous system to the limbic system — the part of the brain that controls emotions and stores our memories.  The limbic system is the seat of the emotional center and is partly responsible for our fight or flight response, our emotional reaction to something, our hormonal secretions, motivation, pain reflex and our mood fluctuations. </p>
<p>Each essential oil has therapeutic properties, in that they are stimulating, calming, sedative, balancing, etc. When we inhale an essential oil molecule, it travels through the nasal passage to a receptor neuron that transports it up to the limbic brain, especially the hypothalamus. Some of the functions of the hypothalamus are to regulate blood pressure, control heart rate and adjust hunger and thirst? Well, if you smell an essential oil that has a vibrationally calming effect on the body, and the hypothalamus receives the input to relax, then it creates neurochemicals that are sent through the body to relax and calm. Likewise if an essential oil has a frequency known to stimulate the body, then the limbic system will conform by sending the message to energize and become more active. Through this manner of transport, one can understand how aromatherapy oils can increase immunity, balance hormonal secretions, dampen or enliven hunger and thirst, and create sexual desire. </p>
